rpi-resize-root

   By default, the images generated by this tool are small, and
   intended to be much smaller than the flash drives they will run
   from. So on first boot, you want to expand the root partition to
   use more of the flash drive.

   This element installs a job that runs once on first boot to do just
   that.
