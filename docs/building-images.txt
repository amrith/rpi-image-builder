Building images

To build images, you will need the disk image builder (DIB) tool. The
tool is available on many platforms but at the time of writing this,
these elements depend on fixes and features in DIB that have not yet
been released. Therefore it is advised that you install DIB from
source.

On your average Linux machine, you should be able to use these
elements after this minimal setup.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y qemu-user-static debootstrap curl kpartx

mkdir -p /opt/stack
cd /opt/stack
git clone http://git.openstack.org/openstack/disk-image-builder

cd disk-image-builder
sudo python ./setup.py install

Once you are done with that setup, you can follow the instructions in
the rpi-generic element (see README.txt in that element) for a simple
usage example.
