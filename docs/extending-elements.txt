Extending elements

If you find issues with these elements, please feel free to let me
know, or submit patches and I'll do my best to incorporate them.

If you would like to create your own elements which can build on top
of these, it is as easy as writing and publishing your own elements
(on your github).

Users can then clone the elements they want, setup the ELEMENTS_PATH
on their machine appropriately and build a composite image based on
elements from many contributors.

For example, a person who clones these repositories would have
something like this:

-+- rpi-image-builder/elements
 |
 +- bobs-elements/elements
 |
 += freds-elements/elements

The user could now setup:

ELEMENTS_PATH=./rpi-image-builder/elements:bobs-elements/elements:freds-elements/elements

And then execute a disk-image-create command referencing elements in
all three locations.

Optionally, if freds elements included element-deps that defined a
dependency on an element in bobs-elements, disk-image-create will
resolve that for you.
